# Installation

**NPM**

```bash
npm install wokcommands
```

Development Build

```bash
npm install github:AlexzanderFlores/WOKCommands#dev
```

# Setup

After you have installed WOKCommands there is a simple setup process:

```JS
const DiscordJS = require('discord.js')
const WOKCommands = require('wokcommands')
require('dotenv').config()

const client = new DiscordJS.Client()

client.on('ready', () => {
  // Initialize WOKCommands
  new WOKCommands(client)
})

client.login(process.env.TOKEN)
```

You might want to specify your commands and features folder, as well as your MongoDB connection path.

This next example assumes you are using a local `commands` folder for your command files, a local `features` folder for event listener files, and that your MongoDB connection path is located within your `.env` file as `MONGO_URI`.

```JS
const DiscordJS = require('discord.js')
const WOKCommands = require('wokcommands')
require('dotenv').config()

const client = new DiscordJS.Client()

client.on('ready', () => {
  // Initialize WOKCommands with specific folders and MongoDB
  new WOKCommands(client, 'commands', 'features')
    .setMongoPath(process.env.MONGO_URI)
})

client.login(process.env.TOKEN)
```

# Setting a Custom Prefix

You can easily set a custom command prefix for your bot using the following:

```JS
const DiscordJS = require('discord.js')
const WOKCommands = require('wokcommands')
require('dotenv').config()

const client = new DiscordJS.Client()

client.on('ready', () => {
  // Initialize WOKCommands with specific folders and MongoDB
  new WOKCommands(client, 'commands', 'features')
    .setMongoPath(process.env.MONGO_URI)
    .setDefaultPrefix('?')
})

client.login(process.env.TOKEN)
```

The default prefix is ! so this code snippet will make your bot's prefix ? instead.

# Creating a Feature

Features are files that include code related to one specific feature of your bot. These often will include event handlers and other utility functions that collectively make up a single feature.

Here is a basic example that simply console logs each message sent:

```JS
// File name: "log-messages.js"
// Folder: "./features"

module.exports = (client, instance) => {
  client.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(message.content)
  })
}
```

`client` is the Discord JS client for your bot.

`instance` is the WOKCommands instance that contains some helper functions.

Each file inside of the "features" folder (or whatever you specified in "Setup") will be ran whenever your bot starts up.

# Configuring a Feature

Often times you may want to only load a feature once your database is connected to. This is useful if you load data from your database when initializing your feature.

You can export a `config` object to delay loading of a feature until your database is connected, as well as specify `displayName` and `dbName` properties:

```JS
module.exports = (client, instance) => {
  console.log('something that requires a database connection')
}

module.exports.config = {
  displayName: 'Test', // Can be changed any time
  dbName: 'TEST', // Should be unique and NEVER be changed once set
  loadDBFirst: true,
}
```

`loadDBFirst` will make this feature only load once your bot has successfully connected to your database.

`displayName` is a name that will eventually be used in this package for enable/disable functionality. This is what users will see when interacting with your bot.

`dbName` is something that once set should NEVER be changed. This is what will be used to keep track of what features are enabled or disabled in each Discord server. Separating these two means you can rename what your user's see without breaking what servers have a feature enabled or disabled. This property should always be in upper case.

# Creating a Command

Creating a command is simple using WOKCommands. The end goal of this package is to support as many command formats as possible. If your commands aren't immediately supported by WOKCommands then please read "Support & Feature Requests"

Here's an example of a basic ping command:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  aliases: ['p'], // Optional
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

Running `!ping` or `!p` will execute this command and reply with "pong". The name of the file is included as a command alias by default.

You can also specify a `name` property for the command, as well as use a `commands` array for aliases:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  name: 'ping', // Optional
  commands: ['runping'], // Optional
  aliases: ['p'], // Optional
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

This will make `!ping`, `!runping`, and `!p` execute the command. There are various popular command formats. This approach of multiple options is meant to help support them out of the box without many changes on your part.

The `callback` function can also be named `run` or `execute`. This function can accept the following parameters:

1. `message`: The standard Message object
2. `args`: An array of all arguments provided with the command
3. `text`: A string version of the args array
4. `client`: The Discord.JS client for your bot
5. `prefix`: The prefix for the server this command is being ran in, or "!" is one is not set
6. `instance`: The WOKCommands instance which will contain some helper methods

Example:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  callback: (message, args, text, client, prefix, instance) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

# Command Categories

You can also specify an optional command category for each command:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  category: 'Fun',
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

This is most useful for a dynamic help menu. The default dynamic help menu uses category emojis to navigate between pages. You can set a category's emoji with the following method:

```JS
const DiscordJS = require('discord.js')
const WOKCommands = require('wokcommands')
require('dotenv').config()

const client = new DiscordJS.Client()

client.on('ready', () => {
  // Initialize WOKCommands with specific folders and MongoDB
  new WOKCommands(client, 'commands', 'features')
    .setMongoPath(process.env.MONGO_URI)
    .setDefaultPrefix('?')
    // Set the category emoji:
    .setCategoryEmoji('Fun', 'ðŸŽ®')
    // You can chain these calls together:
    .setCategoryEmoji('Economy', 'ðŸ’¸')
})

client.login(process.env.TOKEN)
```

The category name "Fun" must match the exact name specified in your commands, this is case sensitive.

# Command Initialization Method

Some commands may require you to run code when they are loaded. This will often include create a basic listener, or fetching data from some source.

You can use the `init()` method within your command to handle this type of functionality:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  category: 'Fun',
  init: (client, instance) => {
    console.log('ran only one time when the bot starts up')
  },
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

`client` is the Discord JS client for your bot.

`instance` is the WOKCommands instance that contains some helper functions.

# Argument Rules

You can easily specify how many arguments are required as well as provide an error message per command. Let's say that you want the above "ping" command to never have any arguments. You can easily accomplish that with the following code:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  minArgs: 0,
  maxArgs: 0,
  syntaxError: 'Incorrect syntax! Use `{PREFIX}ping`',
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

Or let's say you wanted one argument of tagging a member, and no maximum number of arguments:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  minArgs: 1,
  maxArgs: -1, // -1 means no limit
  syntaxError: "Incorrect syntax! Use `{PREFIX}ping <Target user's @>`",
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

In either case the `{PREFIX}` will be replaced with the server's prefix. If the server prefix hasn't been set it will default to "!".

# Global Syntax Errors

In a lot of cases your syntax errors will be very similar. You can specify a global syntax format using the following:

```JS
new WOKCommands(client)
  .setSyntaxError('Incorrect syntax! Please use {PREFIX}{COMMAND} {ARGUMENTS}')
```

The `{PREFIX}`, `{COMMAND}` and `{ARGUMENTS}` must always be in upper case. These will be replaced with the correct content when an error occurs. The `{ARGUMENTS}` variable must be specified in the command like so:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  minArgs: 1,
  maxArgs: -1, // -1 means no limit
  expectedArgs: "<Target user's @>",
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

A per-command syntax error message will always overwrite a global one for that specific command.

# Per-Server Command Prefixes

_This feature requires a database connection to be present._

Allowing server owners to configure your bot's prefix will help prevent prefix collisions with existing bots. There is a simple command for server owners to configure prefixes:

`!prefix [NEW PREFIX]`

The `NEW PREFIX` argument is optional, and omitting it will simply display the current prefix. By default WOKCommands uses "!" as it's command prefix.

# Custom Dynamic Help Menu

The WOKCommands package ships with a dynamic help menu out of the box However each help menu is different and your bot might require specific needs. You can overwrite the default help command by creating your own:

```JS
// Folder: "commands"
// File: "./help.js"

module.exports = {
  callback: (message, args, text, client, prefix, instance) => {
    instance.commandHandler.commands.forEach((command) => {
      console.log(command)
    })
  }
}
```

This will log important information regarding each command. You can use this within a help command to display a meaningful dynamic help menu.

# Enable or Disable a Command

_This feature requires a database connection to be present._

Server owners might not want all commands your bot comes with. It's important to allow them to enable or disable each command, and WOKCommands comes with this functionality out of the box.

Server owners can toggle a command with the following command:

`!command <"enable" | "disable"> <Command Name>`

# Required Permissions

Sometimes you will want to require a Discord permission node before a user can run a command. An example could be an administrative command. Requiring "ADMINISTRATOR" will prevent people without that permission node from running the command. You can easily do that with the following syntax:

```JS
// File name: 'hi.js'
// Folder: './commands'

module.exports = {
  maxArgs: 0,
  requiredPermissions: ['ADMINISTRATOR'],
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('hello')
  },
}
```

Whenever anyone runs that command that doesn't have the "ADMINISTRATOR" permission node, it will tell them they need it. Also if you spell a permission node incorrectly or not upper case it will automatically let you know when your bot starts up.

# Configurable Required Roles

_This feature requires a database connection to be present._

Server owners will often want some commands to only be accessible from users with a specific role. Server owners will have the option to require this for any command your bot provides using the following command:

`!requiredRole <Command Name> <"none" | Tagged Role | Role ID string>`

This will allow server owners to dynamically configure commands for their own server without you needing to change anything as the developer. This is ideal because each will have its own rank for some commands and features. Forcing that rank to be named something specific is constrictive and this option makes your bot more user friendly.

Using "none" will remove all required roles for that command.

# Command Cooldowns

_This feature might require a database connection to be present._

WOKCommands makes it easy to provide per-user cooldowns. These will only affect users in the server where they ran the command, and not globally across multiple servers using your bot.

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  cooldown: '60s',
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

The cooldown can be specified using the following format:

| Character | Duration | Minimum | Maximum | Example |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| s         | Seconds  | 1       | 60      | 30s     |
| m         | Minutes  | 1       | 60      | 10m     |
| h         | Hours    | 1       | 24      | 5h      |
| d         | Days     | 1       | 365     | 3d      |

For durations over 5 minutes a database connection is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Cooldowns with a duration larger than 5 minutes will automatically be updated to your database every 20 seconds. These durations will be loaded when your bot starts up, this ensures that restarts do not affect cooldowns.

# Global Cooldowns

_This feature might requires a database connection to be present._

Some use cases might require a global cooldown over all users for a specific server. This can be easily done with the following:

```JS
// File name: "ping.js"
// Folder "./commands"

module.exports = {
  globalCooldown: '10m',
  callback: (message) => {
    message.reply('pong')
  }
}
```

The minimum duration is 1 minute for global cooldowns. For durations over 5 minutes a database connection is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Cooldowns with a duration larger than 5 minutes will automatically be updated to your database every 20 seconds. These durations will be loaded when your bot starts up, this ensures that restarts do not affect cooldowns.

For more examples of the cooldown format please see the chart at [Command Cooldowns](#command-cooldowns).

<!-- # Configurable Cooldown Error Messages

_This feature requires a database connection to be present._

When using a cooldown you'll want to send a message to inform a user to use the command less often. That can be easily configured like so:

```JS
new WOKCommands(client, 'commands', 'listeners')
  .setCooldownMessage('You must wait to use this command again')
```

# Channel Specific Commands

_This feature requires a database connection to be present._

Sometimes you may want a command to only be ran in a specific channel. WOKCommands includes this functionality and allows server owners to configure this themselves with a command:

`!channelOnly <Command Name> <Channel Tag>`

This will allow the server owners to specify a command and tag a channel to only allow that command to be ran in that channel. Running the exact command again will toggle the channel requirement. -->
